# WasteWise Project Summary

## Project Overview
WasteWise is an AI-powered web platform designed to revolutionize waste management. Its core functionalities include waste classification (identifying waste types from images), providing disposal suggestions, and locating nearby recycling centers. The platform also aims to integrate gamification features to encourage user engagement and promote sustainable waste practices.

## Current Tech Stack

### Backend (Python/Flask)
The backend is built with Python using the Flask framework, providing the API endpoints for waste classification and recycling center lookups.

*   **Framework:** Flask
    *   `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
    *   **CORS:** `flask_cors` is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to make requests to the backend.
*   **Machine Learning (Placeholder):**
    *   **`tensorflow`**, **`numpy`**, **`Pillow`**: These libraries are included in `requirements.txt` as foundational tools for eventual machine learning model integration.
    *   `load_model()`: A placeholder function where the pre-trained ML model (e.g., a CNN/Transfer Learning model) will be loaded.
    *   `preprocess_image()`: A placeholder for image preprocessing logic that will prepare images for the ML model.
    *   `/api/classify` route:
        *   Currently, this endpoint receives an image and **returns dynamic placeholder data** (random English waste type, confidence, disposal method, and recycling centers). This simulates a real ML classification for demonstration purposes.
        *   The `WASTE_LABEL_TRANSLATIONS` dictionary was initially for translating model outputs, but the current dynamic output is already in English.
        *   The `DYNAMIC_RESPONSES` dictionary provides varied placeholder data for different waste types.
*   **Environment Variables:** `python-dotenv` is used to load environment variables (e.g., API keys, although none are actively used yet).
*   **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI):** `gunicorn` is included in `requirements.txt` for production-grade serving of the Flask application, though currently we are running in debug mode for development.
*   **Image Processing:** `opencv-python` is listed in `requirements.txt` for potential future advanced image processing needs.
*   **Dependencies (`requirements.txt`):**
    *   `flask`
    *   `tensorflow==2.19.0` (specific version to manage compatibility)
    *   `numpy==1.26.0` (specific version to manage compatibility with TensorFlow)
    *   `Pillow`
    *   `python-dotenv`
    *   `requests`
    *   `gunicorn`
    *   `opencv-python`
    *   *(Note: `scikit-learn` was removed temporarily due to C++ build tool dependency, can be re-added once build tools are installed).*
*   `/api/recycling-centers` route: A placeholder route for future integration with the Google Maps API.

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
The frontend is a modern web application built with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and designed for an intuitive user experience.

*   **Framework:** React with TypeScript (`npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript`).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
    *   `tailwind.config.js`: Configures Tailwind CSS, including content paths and custom colors (`neon-green`, `neon-cyan`, `green-950`).
    *   `postcss.config.js`: Integrates Tailwind CSS with PostCSS.
    *   `src/index.css`: Imports Tailwind CSS directives.
*   **Navigation:** `react-router-dom` is used for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different pages (Home, About, Dashboard).
    *   `App.tsx`: Sets up the main routing structure.
    *   `Navbar.tsx`: Provides navigation links.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   `@headlessui/react`: Provides accessible UI components (e.g., `Disclosure` used in `Home.tsx` for collapsible sections).
    *   `@heroicons/react/24/outline`: Provides SVG icons used throughout the UI (e.g., for waste types, navigation).
*   **API Communication:** `axios` is used to make HTTP requests to the backend API (e.g., sending images to `/api/classify`).
*   **Image Upload:** `react-dropzone` simplifies drag-and-drop file uploads for the classification feature.
    *   `Home.tsx`: Implements the image upload area and displays classification results.
*   **Particle Background:**
    *   `@tsparticles/react`, `@tsparticles/engine`, `@tsparticles/slim`: Used to create the dynamic particle background animation.
    *   `ParticleBackground.tsx`: Encapsulates the particle animation logic. It initializes the `tsparticles` engine and conditionally renders the particles.
*   **Fonts:**
    *   `@fontsource/inter`, `@fontsource/poppins`, `@fontsource/dm-sans`: Imported to provide custom typography for the application, ensuring a consistent and modern look.
*   **Key Pages/Components:**
    *   `App.tsx`: The root component, setting up routes and global layout.
    *   `Navbar.tsx`: Navigation bar.
    *   `Home.tsx`: The primary waste classification page, including image upload, result display, disposal instructions, and recycling center list.
    *   `About.tsx`: A simple informational page.
    *   `Dashboard.tsx`: A placeholder for user statistics and gamification achievements.
*   **UI Design Principles:** The frontend incorporates a dark-themed gradient aesthetic with neon colors, soft glowing shadows, and subtle hover animations for a visually appealing and modern user experience.

## Future Integrations & Next Steps

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Integrate the actual CNN/Transfer Learning model into the `backend/app.py`'s `classify_waste` function to perform real-time image classification. This will replace the current dynamic placeholder.
*   **Google Maps API:** Implement the Google Maps API in the `get_recycling_centers` route in `backend/app.py` to fetch actual recycling center locations based on user's location or other criteria.
*   **Gamification:** Develop the logic for gamification features, including user authentication, tracking classification counts, awarding points/achievements, and displaying leaderboards in the `Dashboard.tsx` and potentially other frontend components.
*   **User Authentication:** Implement user sign-up/login functionality to personalize the experience and track user progress for gamification.

## How to Run the Application

To run the complete WasteWise application:

1.  **Ensure you are in the project root directory:** `C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Documents\Wastewise`
2.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    python backend/app.py
    ```
    (You can run this in the background if preferred, but for debugging, keeping it in the foreground is useful).
3.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
